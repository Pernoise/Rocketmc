# 👏 Credits

RocketMC is built on OpenLauncher by CesarGarza55
 — huge thanks for the foundation and the logo.
The name RocketMC was inspired by ONE from the Blake Discord server (he didn’t ask to be credited, but we’ll risk it).

# 🧃 License

Open-source under the MIT License.
Use it, fork it, modify it — just don’t slap a new icon on it and call it “UltraLauncher Pro.”

# 🚀 Why RocketMC?

Because it just works.
No paywalls, no ads, no nonsense — just a launcher that respects your time and system resources.
